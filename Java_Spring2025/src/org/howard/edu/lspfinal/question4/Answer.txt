Question #4 – Design Patterns Reflection

While design patterns offer structure and reusability,
an instance where using a design pattern may not be beneficial
is in smaller-scale applications or beginner-level projects.

As discussed in lecture, applying complex patterns—like Abstract Factory or Observer—
can overcomplicate a simple design. This can lead to confusion for new developers,
especially if they aren't fully comfortable with inheritance, interfaces, or polymorphism.

In such cases, forcing a pattern can introduce unnecessary layers, making
maintenance and debugging more difficult than if the code had been kept straightforward.

So while patterns are powerful, our class emphasized that they should only be
applied when the problem genuinely calls for it—not just for the sake of using one.
